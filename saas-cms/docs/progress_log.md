# Progress Log

## 2025-06-26

- **Build Fix:** Resolved PostCSS build error by installing `@tailwindcss/postcss` and updating `postcss.config.js`.
- **Git:** Added a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules`, `.next`, and other unnecessary files from the repository.
- **Planning:** Analyzed the `sitemap.xml` from the previous project to define the scope of the public-facing pages.
- **Documentation:** Created initial versions of `architecture.md` and `tech_stack.md` to establish a clear plan for development.
