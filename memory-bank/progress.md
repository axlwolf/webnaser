# Progress Report for Grupo Naser Website Migration

This document tracks the progress of the Grupo Naser website migration from a static HTML site to a modern content management system (CMS). The current primary approach is based on **Grav CMS**, a lightweight PHP-based flat-file CMS, selected by the client for compatibility with their existing server infrastructure. Previous approaches, including Next.js and PHP + Angular, have been documented and preserved for future reference.

## Current Status: Grav CMS Migration (Active Approach)

- **Date Updated**: June 29, 2025
- **Status**: Planning and Initial Setup Phase
- **Details**: The migration to Grav CMS is the active strategy as per client decision. Grav CMS was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and compatibility with the client's server environment, which does not support Next.js deployments. The detailed migration plan is outlined in `grav_migration_plan.md` and `migration_plan.md`.
- **Completed Tasks**:
  - Documentation updated across key files (`migration_roadmap.md`, `migration_plan.md`, `traditional_migration_plan.md`, `php_angular_comparative_options.md`) to reflect the focus on Grav CMS.
  - Cleared the `naser-modern` directory to repurpose it as the root for Grav CMS setup.
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Setup and Environment Preparation (as per `grav_migration_plan.md`)
  - Awaiting client confirmation on server access details and CSS framework preference (Bootstrap or Tailwind).
  - Next step is to install Grav CMS in the `naser-modern` directory.
- **Timeline Progress**: On track with an estimated total of 8-12 working days for completion of the Grav CMS migration.

## Previous Approaches (On Hold)

1. **Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS**:
   - **Status**: On Hold (Pending Infrastructure Upgrade Next Year)
   - **Details**: Significant progress was made with layout consistency using shared components (`Header` and `Footer`) across main pages in the `naser-modern` directory. This approach is preserved in a separate branch for future use when the client's infrastructure supports Next.js.
   - **Completed Tasks**:
     - Project setup with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
     - Implementation of core pages and components.
   - **Documentation**: Referenced in `migration_roadmap.md` and `look_and_feel_guide.md`.

2. **PHP + Angular Traditional Stack**:
   - **Status**: Explored, Not Selected
   - **Details**: A traditional approach using PHP (Laravel) and Angular was planned and documented in `traditional_migration_plan.md` and `php_angular_comparative_options.md`. The client opted for Grav CMS instead.
   - **Completed Tasks**:
     - Comparative analysis of four PHP + Angular solutions.
     - Detailed migration plan drafted.

## Key Milestones Ahead
- **Grav CMS Setup**: Install Grav CMS and configure the environment in `naser-modern` (Phase 1).
- **Theme Development**: Create a custom Grav theme to match the original site's design (Phase 2).
- **Content Migration**: Transfer static and dynamic content to Grav CMS (Phase 3).
- **Testing and Deployment**: Ensure functionality and deploy to the client's server (Phases 4-5).
- **Handoff**: Provide documentation and training for the client to manage content via Grav CMS (Phase 6).

## Issues and Risks
- **Server Compatibility**: Need to confirm PHP version (7.3.6+ required for Grav) and file write permissions for the flat-file system.
- **Client Feedback**: Awaiting input on styling preferences (Bootstrap vs. Tailwind) which may impact theme development timeline.
- **Content Management Learning Curve**: Client may require additional support to become familiar with Grav's admin interface.

## Next Steps
- Obtain client confirmation on server details and styling preferences.
- Proceed with Grav CMS installation and setup as outlined in `grav_migration_plan.md`.
- Update this progress report after each phase completion to track advancement.

This progress report ensures transparency on the migration process, focusing on the Grav CMS approach while maintaining records of previous strategies for future reference.
